There are several methods for image matching, including:

    Feature-based methods: These methods extract distinctive features from images, such as SIFT or SURF, and then match the features between images.

    Template matching: This method involves comparing a small image (template) to a larger image and finding the region that best matches the template.

    Deep learning-based methods: These methods use neural networks to learn the features of images and match them. Examples include Siamese networks and triplet networks.

    Hash-based methods: These methods use hashing algorithms to convert images into a compact binary representation and then compare the hash values to find similar images.

    Phase Correlation: This method is used to find the relative shift between two similar images in order to align them.

All of these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and the type of images being matched.
